# LLM_LAB_Tracking_of_habits

Using GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio Code has helped us understand both how useful it can be and where its limitations are. Overall, we were surprised by how much it can assist when you give it clear instructions. If you know how to explain what you want, Copilot suggests code that can save you a lot of time and make your work easier.

That said, we also saw that it can’t do everything. For example, we asked it to create a .csv file to store habit data, but that’s when we realized it struggles with more specific or complex tasks on its own.

In conclusion, Copilot isn’t a magical tool, but when used properly, it’s a great support. It helped us be more clear with our ideas and made us realize that communicating well with the tool makes a big difference in the results it gives.
